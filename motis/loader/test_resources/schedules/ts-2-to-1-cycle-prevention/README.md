# Description
The test describes a through service rule where two services s_1, s_2 are related with a third service s_3 and s_4. The traffic days of s_1 and s_2 are not disjunct - that seems be suspicious but exists in the HRD. The test provokes an infinite layer cascade that should be avoided by the usage of directed edges.
