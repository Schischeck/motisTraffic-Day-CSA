/// this class provides synchronization and distinguishes two kinds of access:

///  - write (changing data)
///  - read (reading without changing)
///
///
/// synchronization properties:
///
///  - there may be an arbitrary number of parallel readers as long as there is
///    no write access.
///  - write access is exclusive. there cannot be any reads or other writes
///    at the same time.
///  - write accesses are prioritized. this means that no new read
///    access will be granted as soon as there is at least one write access
///    waiting.
///  - write accesses are queued in their request order.
///  - active read accesses cannot be stopped. thus, queued write requests
///    need to wait for all read accesses to finish.
